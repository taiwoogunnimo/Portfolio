							<h1>About Me</h1>
						</header>

						<p align="justify">My name is Taiwo Ogunnimo, and I am a Communications Specialist and Strategist with a strong background in content creation, media relations, and brand storytelling.</p>
						<p align="justify">I hold a bachelor’s degree in English studies from the prestigious Babcock University, Nigeria. Driven by a deep passion for literature and effective communication, I went on to earn a master’s in English literature from the University of Lagos. To further strengthen my expertise in the evolving global media landscape, I completed a second master’s degree in communication, Culture, and Media at Coventry University, United Kingdom.</p>
						<p align="justify">As a communication strategist, I have led and contributed to various brand and media projects across corporate and creative industries. My responsibilities typically include developing and implementing communication strategies, crafting compelling brand narratives, managing content production across digital and traditional platforms, and ensuring cohesive messaging that aligns with organizational goals. I am skilled in identifying communication gaps, managing public perception, creating engaging multimedia content, and building audience engagement through storytelling.</p>
						<p align="justify">In my role as Brand and Communication Executive at TrustBanc Group, I led the development and execution of strategic promotional activities to enhance brand visibility across multiple locations. I managed the creation and design of both online and offline marketing materials and worked cross-functionally with product heads to translate departmental goals into effective branding solutions. This contributed significantly to customer acquisition and brand loyalty.</p>
						<p align="justify">At SceneOne Productions, I worked as a Communications Strategist where I was involved in the end-to-end production of digital content—from concept development to scripting, video editing, and distribution. I collaborated with professionals across fashion, music, and film to create high-impact visual and written content for diverse audiences. I also wrote and produced promotional materials for films, series, live events, and social campaigns, while coordinating with internal teams to ensure brand consistency and audience resonance.</p>
						<p align="justify">I previously anchored “Spill the Tea with Tee” on Phoenix Radio (CUSU, Coventry), a show that explored the intersection between media narratives and real-life experiences in fashion, relationships, culture, lifestyle, and education.</p>
						<p align="justify">As a creative storyteller, I have written and directed two short films hosted on my YouTube channel - (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2HbsNFHO671e-s6MXXZTPQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TwoTees Productions</a>). My written work spans platforms like <a href="https://medium.com/@OgunnimoTaiwo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Medium</a> and <a href="https://vocal.media/authors/taiwo-ogunnimo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vocal Media</a>, where I share thoughtful reflections and cultural commentary.</p>
						<p align="justify">Recognized by one of Africa’s leading film award bodies for my storytelling abilities, I continue to merge creativity and strategy to influence how stories are told, how brands are perceived, and how audiences engage with content in a fast-evolving media world.</p>
